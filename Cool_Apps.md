There are some interesting applications out there. for example:

# Android

* [MrHyde](http://faudroids.org/MrHyde), an Android application to manage Jekyll sites on Github-pages. Not only will it give you an editor, it will let you preview your site too!

# Linux

## Editors
* [vim](http://www.vim.org/): Yep, I err on the side of vim in emacs v. vim.
* [ed](http://www.gnu.org/software/ed): Is it a joke? Is it a serious editor?
  You decide.
