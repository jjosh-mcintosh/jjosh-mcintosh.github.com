Seeing as I am getting back to having fun technical things to talk about again,
it's time to reboot the blog. Allow me to reintroduce myself:

# My Name is Joshua McIntosh
I am a self-described linux enthusiast, systems admin, dabbler in programming.
As of late I've been working with
[Python](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)),
[Puppet](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_(software)), and [IBM's Platform
LSF](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_LSF) (The last mostly out of necessity).

Computing and Computer Science has been a hobby as well as my professional
field. As I work further, I find myself especially interested in the design of
distributed systems (such as Google's
[Chubby](http://research.google.com/archive/chubby.html)) and their
potential applications to infrastructure, applications and services. I'm also
interested in real-time monitoring, though I'm currently in a non-standard
environment for that sort of information.

In my free time, I'm trying to keep my house tidy and be a loving Husband to my
wife Nicole. My current opportunity at work is a great one (I'm currently a
contractor hoping for a full-time position), but I spend a lot of time in
commute due to how far away work is. Still, we are able to make the best of our
evenings and weekends.

While I can't guarantee much about what I might talk about (or how often I'll
write up a post), I'll try to keep any readers up to date on interesting
information.

Thanks for reading,
