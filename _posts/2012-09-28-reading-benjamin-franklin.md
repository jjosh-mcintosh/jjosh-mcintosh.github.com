A while ago (for my 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, I believe), my grandparents
were able to secure for me a copy of The [Harvard Classics](http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.bartleby.com/hc/&sa=U&ei=yRZmUKLKEozriwLc4YDYDQ&ved=0CCUQFjAB&usg=AFQjCNEEE3btVsTIoiQq3dkqf7W6cC766g).
This collection of books covers everything from History to Philosophy to
science (Science circa ~1910, at least). The editor of this collection had
this to say:

<blockquote>"Dr.Charles W.Eliot, the former Harvard president who edited the series, 
maintained that if one read just 15 minutes a day from the 51 volumes he 
assembled, it would constitute "a good substitute for a liberal education 
to anyone who would read them with devotion."

</blockquote>

I'm embarassed to say that I haven't read any of the stories all the way
through--but I'm attempting that now, starting with Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography.

Franklin notes that he comes from humble beginnings. He's the youngest male
in a succession of youngest males (going back 3 generations). As a child,
he was educated in reading, writing and math, although of the three he
maintains he was not gifted in math. He was initially going to go into
preisthood with his education, but his father finally decided to pair him
with one of his older brothers in a printing house. This would be 
Franklin's initial and main business, despite being known for scientific studies and
statesmanship.

While Franklin's story spans as much of his life as practical, there are a few things that
stand out:

### He writes with personality.
I think that plenty of people would expect such a read to be boring and trudging. In actuality, Franklin
has plenty of wit and charm for his reader, making it easier to read<strong><sup>1</sup></strong>.

### He admits some mistakes he has made, and would love to redo.
Throughout his tale he recounts of "Errata" in his life, things he would like to redo if he could. Perhaps fortunately, for
some of these, he is able to reverse some of the consequences of his life. An example of this would be when he marries Deborah Reed 
(sometimes spelled Read).

He tends to be fairly frank about these errata, helping to reinforce the human side of this legend.

### He has axioms and virtues sometimes ahead of his time
Many of his axioms are practically a part of American culture, meanwhile his virtues regulated his life. While he's some of his
ideas are now considered outdated, he was culturally ahead of his time on others, such as vegetarianism.

<p><small markdown='1'>__update 10/12/2012__: I still have about 70 pages to go in the book (some family issues have come up since I started writing this), so
I reserve the right to add more to this :)</small></p>
