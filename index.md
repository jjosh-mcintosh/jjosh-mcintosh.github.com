## Hi!

<h3>Note</h3>
It's been a while since I've written anything here, hasn't it? I tend to get
embarassed at my writing, but I won't get rid of it (indeed, I don't think I
could if I wanted to). Because of that, I'm going to move old writings off.
To read them, you'll have to go back in history (Well, the revision history).

These github pages are host to both my github projects and my personal blog. My biggest concern about personal 
information is that it might be seen as unprofessional, I supposeâ€”but I also want whoever reads this to 
get a holistic view of who I am, both professionally and personally.  

Also, the fact that It uses github--and thus requires knowledge of an scm--can only work in my favor.
To keep in the spirit of this, I dont have a comments section on the site--however, if you have anything
you'd like to point out or say, use github issues and make a commit to whichever post, appending the information
you'd like to change (or add to) as a `&lt; blockquote &gt;`. If you're faithful to that, and I deem 
the content worthy, I'll update the post.
