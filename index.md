<p>I am a young linux admin that aspires to be an engineer.
I am an Arch Linux user and enthusiast, a Redhat Admin, and programmer (mostly for
administration tasks).</p>
<br>
<p>In addition, I have been known to do small time web development, using some tools.
My drawback in that is that I'm not necessarily artistically inclined<big><strong>*</strong></big>.</p>

I'll try not to make this too much like a dating profile, but I'm not sure what all I will 
put here. I figure I could put up plenty of information about my github projects (though I dont
have many yet), or I could put down personal information. My biggest concern about personal information
is that it might be seen as unprofessional, I supposeâ€”but I also want whoever reads this to get a holistic
view of who I am, both professionally and personally.
