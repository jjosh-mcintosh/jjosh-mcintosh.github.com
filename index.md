## Hi!

<p>I am a young linux admin that aspires to be an engineer.
I am an Arch Linux user and enthusiast, a Redhat Admin, and programmer (mostly for
administration tasks).</p>
<br>
<p>In addition, I have been known to do small time web development, using some tools.
My drawback in that is that I'm not necessarily artistically inclined<big><strong>*</strong></big>: don't expect me to know my way around photoshop just yet.</p>

<p>These github pages are host to both my github projects and my personal blog. My biggest concern about personal 
information is that it might be seen as unprofessional, I supposeâ€”but I also want whoever reads this to 
get a holistic view of who I am, both professionally and personally.</p>

<p>Also, the fact that It uses github--and thus requires knowledge of an scm--can only work in my favor.</p>
