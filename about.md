# Hi, I'm Joshua McIntosh.

I like Linux, python and building things. I have a few repos on github, mostly
personal stuff.

I'm also a fan of sci-fi Television, comics (though I need to get further into
the medium), reading and gaming. I'm happily married to my wonderful wife
Nicole, and living in the California East Bay.
